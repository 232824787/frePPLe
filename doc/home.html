a Free Production Planning Library</font></u></H1>

<p>Plenty of planning tools are available for various production problems,
different subprocess, different solver techniques.... A bit suprising, no
proper solutions exist in the open source domain. Plenty of users are left
with  expensive and inflexible tools, and are resorting to spreadsheets to meet
their needs.</p>
<p>This project aims at building a lightweight framework that easily and quickly
delivers a solution for production planning problems. The initial focus is on
small to medium sized master planning problems for the discrete manufacturing
industry.</p>
<p>For the developer community, the project is also trying to establish a
common ground framework for planning applications. Rather than building the
basic building blocks (e.g.  item, buffer, bill of material, ...) from scratch
over and over again, developers can leverage a proven framework to extend
with their own extension modules.</p>
<p>The word "free" in the project name refers to liberty, not price. Think of
"freedom of speech" rather than "free beer": see also
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">the free
software definition</a>.
<p><b>The software is currently in a early-beta stage. This means the software
isn't suitable for end users yet. There's plenty of work on the code and the
documentation. I released at this early stage to collect feedback and to gather
 interested souls to contribute to the project.</b><br>
So, browse the site, have a look at the code and let
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#106;&#x64;&#101;&#116;&#x61;&#x65;&#x79;&#101;&#64;&#117;&#x73;&#x65;&#x72;&#115;&#46;&#115;&#111;&#x75;&#x72;&#x63;&#x65;&#102;&#x6f;&#x72;&#103;&#x65;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#116;">

<p>All code of this project is released under the GNU lesser general public
license.
I strongly encourage you to visit the website of the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a> and

license protects my and your work.</br>
The licence agreement is provided in the file 'COPYING' in the installation
directory.</p>

<p>The project is developped for 32-bit linux and Windows environments, with
Linux being the primary development platform. Porting to other platforms is
discussed under the developer section of the documentation.
