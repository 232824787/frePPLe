<a name="top"></a>FREPPLE<br>
a Free Production Planning Library
</font></u></i></b></p>
<p>Production planning problems are very
common in manufacturing and distribution. System support is available
from a
wide range of vendors. All tools on the market have pretty much the
following
characteristics in common:</p>
<p>Are expensive to purchase, implement and maintain.</p>
<p>Are built on proprietary architectures and
modeling constructs.</p>
<p>Result quite often in systems that are
complex, hard-to-use, difficult to implement and with low user
acceptance.</p>
<p>Faced with this, planners and small
businesses resort to basic spreadsheets for planning their production
environment.</p>
<p>With this project, we are trying to
build a light weight tool that can solve simple master planning
problems without
much hassle. It should allow planners to have access to more advanced
functionality while maintaining the flexiblity, ease of use of their
original
spreadsheets.</p>
<p>For the developer community, the project
is also trying to establish some common ground framework for planning
applications. Rather than building the basic building blocks (e.g.
Items,
buffers, boms...) from scratch over and over again, developers can
leverage a
proven and tested application set to extend. The library is written in
C++.</p>
<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="platforms" href="#top">top</a></p>
<h1>Supported Platforms</h1>
The library has been compiled and tested on the following platforms:
<ul>
  <li>Windows 2000 and GCC v3.3.3 compiler (Cygwin) but deprecated</li>
  <li>Windows 2000/XP and GCC v3.4.4 compiler (Cygwin)</li>
  <li>Windows 2000 and Visual C++ 7.0 compiler </li>
  <li>Windows 2000 and Intel C++ 9.0 compiler but not tested actively</li>
  <li>Windows 2000 and Borland 5.5 compiler </li>
  <li>Linux and GCC v3.4 compiler</li>
</ul>
The C++ commands and functions are as ANSI compliant as possible, with
potentially inportable functions being configured using autoconf.
Porting to platforms as well with a modern C++ compiler (i.e. supporting RTTI,
namespaces, exceptions, STL, ...) should be relatively easy.
<p>If you get it running successfully on a different platform please
let
<a href="mailto:johan_de_taeye@yahoo.com">us</a> know, so it can be
documented.</p>

<h1>Software Prerequisites</h1>
<p>No additional software is required to use the executables coming with a 
binary distribution. No additional software is required also when you want to 
develop your own applications using the compiled libraries coming with a 
binary distribution.</p>
<p>Developers building the library from the source code or developing extensions
will need to install a number of additional components. These are listed as part
of the build instructions.

<h1>Project goal and concepts</h1>
<p></p>
Not written up yet, but believe I know where I'm heading...

<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="xxx" href="#top">top</a></p>
<h1>Model characteristics</h1>
<p>Basic building blocks<br>
Have name, category and can be nested in hierarchical trees.<br>
Buffer, item, lot, resource, operation.<br>
Connected by loads and flows.</p>
<p>Higher level building blocks are based upon these.<br>
E.g. Bom, forecast, ...</p>
<p>Problems are flagged when the plan shows infeasibilities or
situations
requiring user attention.</p>
<p>Subclassing the standard classes allows building more complex and
customized models.</p>
<p>Data is currently read in from XML files.<br>
Soon a flat file based input is also expected. Later, a database
interface could
also be implemented.</p>
<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="solver" href="#top">top</a></p>
<h1>Solver characteristics</h1>
<p>The model and the solver are logically
divided. This makes it possible to use mulitple with the same model.<span
 style="">&nbsp;<br>
The currently application comes with a single solver that is described
in more
detail below.</span></p>
<p>The building blocks can be grouped in a
number of independent clusters. Each cluster is solved seperately by a
multi-threaded solver.</p>
<p>The solver uses a heuristic-based algorithm.<br>
The logic is fully deterministic.<br>
The solver is based on common sense planning logic rather than some
mathematical
optimization construct.<br>
These features result in a simple, easy to undertand and easy to extend
solution. The plan will make sense to the planner, but is not
necessarily a
mathematical optimum.</p>
<p>In the
future, a second solver based on linear programming is expected to be
added.
This will allow to generate mathematically optimal solutions for
subparts of the
planning problem.</p>
<p>The algorithm is able to generate a number
of different plan types:<br>
- material constrained plan<br>
- lead time constrained plan<br>
- capacity constrained plan</p>
<p>- fully
unconstrained plan, a.k.a. MRP run.</p>
<p>- plans with
multiple of the basic constraints enabled, e.g. Material and leadtime
constrained.</p>
<p>- fully
constrained plan, i.e. Constrained by material, leadtime and capacity.</p>

<h1>Example model</h1>
<p>In this section we describe a small
planning problem. We show how it is modeled and planned using our
application.</p>
<p>This is by no means a full user manual, but only illustrates the
basic concepts.</p>
