<H1><u><font size="+4"><a name="top"></a>FREPPLE<br>
a Free Production Planning Library</font></u></H1>

<p>Plenty of planning tools are available for various production problems,
different subprocess, different solver techniques.... A bit suprising, no 
proper solutions exist in the open source domain. Plenty of users are left 
with  expensive and inflexible tools, and are resorting to spreadsheets to meet 
their needs.</p>
<p>This project aims at building a lightweight framework that easily and quickly 
delivers a solution for production planning problems. The initial focus is on small 
to medium sized master planning problems for the discrete manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>For the developer community, the project is also trying to establish a 
common ground framework for planning applications. Rather than building the 
basic building blocks (e.g.  item, buffer, bill of material, ...) from scratch 
over and over again, developers can leverage a proven framweork to extend 
with their own extension modules.</p>
<p>The word "free" in the project name refers to liberty, not price. Think of "freedomof speech" rather than "free beer": see also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">the free software definition</a>.
<p><b>The software is currently in a early-beta stage. This means the software
isn't suitable for end users yet. There's plenty of work on the code and the 
documentation.<br>
I released at this early stage to collect feedback and to gather some 
interested souls to contribute to the project.</b></p>

<H1>License</H2>
<p>All code of this project is released under the GNU lesser general public
license.
I strongly encourage you to visit the website of the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_blank">Free Software Foundation</a> and
learn how this
license protects my and your work.</br>
The licence agreement is provided in the file 'COPYING' in the installation
directory.</p>

<p align="right"><a name="platforms" href="#top">top</a></p>
<h1>Supported Platforms</h1>
<p>The primary platform is <b>linux</b>, using the gcc compiler.</p>
<p>The library can also be compiled on <b>windows</b> (tested on windows 2000 and 
windows xp), using the Microsoft Visual Studio, the Borland 5.5 or the Intel C++ 
compiler. The windows version currently offers less functionality. Specifically, 
multi-threading and dynamically loaded modules aren't supported on this platform.</p>
<p>The C++ commands and functions are as ANSI compliant as possible and porting to 
various UNIX flavors shouldn't cause too much of an effort. The developer 
documentation has a section on porting the software.</p>
<hr>

<p align="right"><a name="prerequisites" href="#top">top</a></p>
<h1>Software Prerequisites</h1>
<p>No additional software is required to use the executables coming with a 
binary distribution. No additional software is required also when you want to 
develop your own applications using the compiled libraries coming with a 
binary distribution.</p>
<p>Developers building the library from the source code or developing extensions
will need to install a number of additional components. These are listed as part
of the build instructions.

<h1>Project goal and concepts</h1>
<p></p>
Not written up yet, but believe I know where I'm heading...
<p></p>
<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="xxx" href="#top">top</a></p>
<h1>Model characteristics</h1>
<p>Basic building blocks<br>
Have name, category and can be nested in hierarchical trees.<br>
Buffer, item, lot, resource, operation.<br>
Connected by loads and flows.</p>
<p>Higher level building blocks are based upon these.<br>
E.g. Bom, forecast, ...</p>
<p>Problems are flagged when the plan shows infeasibilities or
situations
requiring user attention.</p>
<p>Subclassing the standard classes allows building more complex and
customized models.</p>
<p>Data is currently read in from XML files.<br>
Soon a flat file based input is also expected. Later, a database
interface could
also be implemented.</p>
<hr>
<p align="right"><a name="solver" href="#top">top</a></p>
<h1>Solver characteristics</h1>
<p>The model and the solver are logically
divided. This makes it possible to use mulitple with the same model.<span
 style="">&nbsp;<br>
The currently application comes with a single solver that is described
in more
detail below.</span></p>
<p>The building blocks can be grouped in a
number of independent clusters. Each cluster is solved seperately by a
multi-threaded solver.</p>
<p>The solver uses a heuristic-based algorithm.<br>
The logic is fully deterministic.<br>
The solver is based on common sense planning logic rather than some
mathematical
optimization construct.<br>
These features result in a simple, easy to undertand and easy to extend
solution. The plan will make sense to the planner, but is not
necessarily a
mathematical optimum.</p>
<p>In the
future, a second solver based on linear programming is expected to be
added.
This will allow to generate mathematically optimal solutions for
subparts of the
planning problem.</p>
<p>The algorithm is able to generate a number
of different plan types:<br>
- material constrained plan<br>
- lead time constrained plan<br>
- capacity constrained plan</p>
<p>- fully
unconstrained plan, a.k.a. MRP run.</p>
<p>- plans with
multiple of the basic constraints enabled, e.g. Material and leadtime
constrained.</p>
<p>- fully
constrained plan, i.e. Constrained by material, leadtime and capacity.</p>

<h1>Example model</h1>
<p>In this section we describe a small
planning problem. We show how it is modeled and planned using our
application.</p>
<p>This is by no means a full user manual, but only illustrates the
basic concepts.</p>
