<H1><u><font size="+4"><a name="top"></a>FREPPLE<br>
a Free Production Planning Library</font></u></H1>

<p>Plenty of planning tools are available for various production problems,
different subprocess, different solver techniques.... A bit suprising, no
proper solutions exist in the open source domain. Users often are left
with  expensive and inflexible tools and resort to spreadsheets to meet
their needs.</p>
<p>This project aims at building an open source lightweight framework that easily
and quickly delivers a solution for production planning problems. The initial
focus is on small to medium sized master planning problems for the discrete
manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>For the developer community, the project is also trying to establish a
common ground framework for planning applications. Rather than building the
basic building blocks (e.g.  item, buffer, bill of material, ...) from scratch
over and over again, developers can leverage a proven framework to extend
with their own extension modules.</p>
<p>The word "free" in the project name refers to liberty, not price. Think of
"freedom of speech" rather than "free beer": see
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">the free
software definition</a>.
<p><b>The software is currently in a early-beta stage. This means the software
isn't suitable for end users yet. There's plenty of work left.
I released at this early stage to collect feedback and to gather interested souls
to contribute to the project.</b><br>
So, browse the site, have a look at the code and mail
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#106;&#x64;&#101;&#116;&#x61;&#x65;&#x79;&#101;&#64;&#117;&#x73;&#x65;&#x72;&#115;&#46;&#115;&#111;&#x75;&#x72;&#x63;&#x65;&#102;&#x6f;&#x72;&#103;&#x65;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#116;">

<H2>Features:</H2>
<ul>
<li><b>Modeling and solving framework for discrete manufacturing environments.</b><br>
Key modeling constructs are:<ul>
<li>Item</li>
<li>Buffer</li>
<li>Resource</li>
<li>Operation</li>
<li>Demand</li>
</ul>
See <a href="entitydiagram.pdf">here</a> for a short domain model (requires Acrobat Reader).<br>
A complete <a href="classdiagram.pdf">class diagram</a>
and <a href="reference/index.html">API reference</a> are available to developers.</li>

<li><p><b>Heuristic, "MRP-like" solving algorithm</b> respecting capacity, material
and leadtime constraints.</p></li>

<li><p>Completely <b>XML</b>-based data input and output.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Extensible and customizable architecture.</b><br>
New modeling constructs and solving algorithms can be added as plugin modules.</p></li>

<li>Frepple comes as a <b>'library' developed in C++</b>.<br>
It has no graphical user interface as such and requires to be deployed in
a 'application'.<br>
Different applications are envisioned:
<ul>
<li>Standalone application for use at the command line</li>
<li><i>Coming soon!</i> Apache module for browser based user interface and network based access</li>
<li><i>Coming very soon!</i> Microsoft Excel frontend, using the XML editing capabilities</li>
<li>Accessed from programming languages such as java, python, perl or visual basic
<li>Linked into your own C or C++ application</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><p><b>Supported on 32-bit linux and Windows environments</b>, with
Linux being the primary development platform.<br>
Porting to other platforms is discussed under the developer section
of the documentation.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Licenced under the GNU lesser general public license.</b><br>
Learn <a href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_blank">here</a>
how this license protects my and your work.</p></li>

<li><p>To finish, a pretty bold statement :-)<br>
<b>Frepple will be the world's first true open source advanced planning system.</b></p></li>
</ul>
