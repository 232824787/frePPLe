<H1><u><font size="+4"></a>frePPLe<br>
a Free Production Planning Library</font></u></H1>

<p>Frepple aims at building a lightweight open source framework that easily
and quickly delivers a solution for production planning problems. The initial
focus is on small to medium sized planning problems for the discrete
manufacturing industry.</p>

<p>Production planning software traditionally has been an area with plenty of
home-grown, extremely specialised and/or very primitive solutions.
<br>Strangely enough, while creative and innovative open source solutions pop up
in all computing areas, production planning software still tends to be a very
closed world full of academic, proprietary and expensive solutions.
Till now...<br>
Frepple is the first open source production planning toolkit for your day-to-day
planning problems.</p>

<p>For the developer community, the project is also trying to establish a
common ground framework for planning applications. Rather than rebuilding the
basic foundation from scratch over and over again, developers can now leverage
a proven framework to extend with their own extension modules.<br>
New workflows and functionality can now be built much quicker and easier.</p>

<p>The word "free" in the project name refers to liberty, not price. Think of
"freedom of speech" rather than "free beer": see
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">the free
software definition</a>.</p>

<p>The software is still young. The functionality and API are enhanced very quickly.<br>
Plenty of feedback is required to move the project forward. So, browse the site,
have a look at the software and please mail
<a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#102;&#114;&#101;&#112;&#112;&#108;&#101;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">
us</a> your feedback.<br>
While there's plenty of work left, the software is quickly getting into a state
where real-life problems can be handled efficiently.</p>

<H2>The main features in brief:</H2>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Modeling and solving framework for discrete manufacturing environments.</b><br>
Key modeling constructs are:<ul>
<li>Item</li>
<li>Buffer</li>
<li>Resource</li>
<li>Operation</li>
<li>Demand</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Heuristic "MRP-like" solving algorithm</b> respecting capacity, material
and leadtime constraints.</p></li>

<li><p><b>XML</b>-based data input and output.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Extensible and customizable architecture.</b><br>
New modeling constructs and solving algorithms can be developed in C++ and loaded
as a plugin module.</p></li>

<li><p>Frepple comes as a <b>'library' developed in C++</b>.<br>
It has no graphical user interface as such and requires to be deployed in
a 'application'.<br>
Different applications are envisioned:
<ul>
<li>Standalone application for use at the command line</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel frontend</li>
<li>Accessable from programming languages such as java, python, perl or visual basic
<li>Can be linked into your own C or C++ application</li>
<li>A reference <b>browser-based user interface</b> and <b>database schema</b>
are based on the powerful Django framework.<br> Both can very easily be extended and
customized.</li>
</ul>
</p></li>

<li><p>Embeds <b>Python</b> as scripting language.<br>
Allows for flexible and easy integration and customization.</p></li>

<li><p>Supported on <b>linux</b> and <b>Windows</b> environments.</p></li>

<li><p>Licenced under the <b>GNU lesser general public license</b>.</p></li>

</ul>
