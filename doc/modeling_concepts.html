<H2>Item</H2>
aka product, material
Attributes are delivery operation,
<H2>Buffer</H2>
aka sku, inventory
Attributes are item, location, producing operation,
<H2>Resource</H2>
aka workcentre, capacity
<H2>Demand</H2>
aka forecast, orders, backlog
A demand represents a independent demand to be planned. It can represent
a customer order or a forecast.
Attributes are due date, item, quantity, priority
<H2>Operation</H2>
Defines an activity
<H2>Item</H2>
An item defines the products being planned, sold, stored and/or
manufactured. Buffers and demands have a reference an item.
<H2>Flow</H2>
A flow represent the production or consumption of material from a buffer.
A flow is attached to an operation.
<H2>Load</H2>
A load links a resource to a certain operation.
<H2>Operation Plan</H2>
Plans an activity
Attributes are operation, quantity, start date, end date
<H2>Calendar</H2>
<H2>Location</H2>
Buffers and resources are linked to a (physical or logical) location.
Locations are merely used for simple association, and have no active use in the
model.

<H2>Modeling limitations</H2>
<p>The model components are very generic and can easily be combined and nested
into a wide range of models. Not all of these constructs are handled correctly 
by the solver, either because of some implicit assumption, either because of 
the code structure, either because of uncomplete code, etc... In this section 
we document a number of such cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operation hierarchies should be restricted to two levels only, where
possible.</li>
<li>Attach flows and loads to the lowest operations only, where possible.</li>
<li>Don't attach a consuming flow at multiple levels in an operation hierarchy.
<br>E.g. Top operation consumes a certain material, and a suboperation consumes
the same material again.</li>
<li>Similarly, don't load the same resource at multiple levels in an operation
hierarchy</li>
<li>Hierarchy structures of resources and buffers are untested. Only demand
hierarchies are currently supported.</li>
</ul>
