<H1>Library usage</H1>
<p>This page discusses the different ways the framework can be accessed from
your different environments. The list is definately not exhaustive, and is
mentioned here to give you some possibilities and to wet your appetite...</p>
The general principles are pretty simple:
<ul>
<li>The focus of frepple is on a common library and framework.<br> Usage of
the framework by a wide range of application and through a wide range of
technologies is intended.</li>
<li>All clients should normally access the library through the well-defined
interface FreppleInterface.<br>This interface can then accessed with a wide
range of technologies, as described below.</li>
<li>The public interface is of the library is synchroneous, i.e. a client's
function call returns only when the complete processing is finished.</li>
<li>The interface can throw exceptions, and the client is responsible for
handling those correcty.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Standalone application</H2>
<p>A simple command-line application is available. All you need to use it is
a set of XML flat files that you feed to the application:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px">frepple file1.xml<br>
frepple file2.xml file3.xml<br>
frepple dir_with_xml_files<br>
command | frepple</p>
<p>The application will execute all commands defined in the xml-files and then
exit. The program returns an exit code reflecting any processing errors.</p>
<p>Use the option "-help" or "-?" to get a list of possible flags that can be
passed on the command line.</p>

<H2>C++ library</H2>
<p>The framework can be compiled into a shared or static library which you then
link into your application. Use the header file plannerinterface.h for the
interface declarations.</p>

<H2>Access from java and scripting languages</H2>
<p>The frepple functionality can be accessed from scripting
languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, etc... The scripting language will
dynamically load frepple as a shared library. Using the SWIG tool examples
for perl, java and python are provided.<br>
When building clients in this way, remember that the scripting language
will load the frepple shared library and all memory allocated by frepple
(which can be a lot for large models!) will be owned by the scripting language
process. For large models this may not be a very appropriate integration
method.</p>

<H2>Apache module</H2>
<p>A prototype user interface is available where Frepple is running as a module
in an Apache web server. The module generates XML content that is rendered
in a web browser application which is based on AJAX principles.<br>
Given the large amount of data maintained by Frepple in memory, this is a
pretty unorthodox usage of Apache. Frepple will need its own, dedicated Apache
instance to live in.</p>

<H2>Webservice, Corba server object, ...</H2>
<p>More alternatives exist to access the Frepple functionality.</p>
