<p>This page captures information on the performance of the planning module.
Performance is defined here in the broadest sense of the word and covers cpu as
well as memory usage. It covers the areas of <ul>
<li><a href="reference">Performance of some reference models</a></li>
<li><a href="notes">Notes on cpu and memory impact of certain features</a></li>
</ul></p>

<ul>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>Memory usage</li>
<li>Profiling analysis</li>
</ul></p>

<H2><a name="notes"/>Notes</H2>
<p>In this section a number of notes are captured that capture our knowledge
on various items affecting the performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Among the different platforms, cygwin is clearly the worst choice. In terms
of cpu-time and compilation time it is clearly below the expectations.</li>
</ul>
