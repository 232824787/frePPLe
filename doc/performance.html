well as memory usage. It covers the areas of <ul>
<li><a href="reference">Performance of some reference models</a></li>
<li><a href="notes">Notes on cpu and memory impact of certain features</a></li>
</ul>

<li>Timing</li>
<li>Memory usage</li>
<li>Profiling analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>In this section a number of notes are captured that capture our knowledge
on various items affecting the performance.</p>
<ul>
