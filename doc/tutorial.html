@todo incomplete tutorial documentation

Model 1: A single buffer, single item, no production, and inventory is being
depleted by demands. Illustrate different plan types.<br>
Model 2: Add procured material supply, and see how demand is being shorted and
lated.<br>
Model 3: Adding a make operation, and see how it is used to create more
material. Also show how raw material is being consumed.<br>
Model 4: Adding a resource and see how capacity constraints change the plan.<br>
Model 5: Use buy and make as alternate operations, and illustrate how the plan
helps in making 'make or buy' decisions.<br>
Conclusions: The tutorial model remains pretty basic, but it hopefully
illustrates the key features of the tool: easay to use, easy to understand, fast
and flexible.<br>

Sections:<br>
- description<br>
- xml file of the model, highlighting changes to previous model<br>
- running the model and the results<br>
- suggested exercises and variations<br>
