This directory is used to create an RPM distribution.
The resulting binary and source package can then be installed in your
Linux distribution.

The RPM is written with the Fedora and Red Hat distributions in mind.
With a little effort it should work fine for Mandrake, SUSE... etc
Debian and derived distributions (eg Ubuntu) use a different packaging
mechanism, but can still install a RPM-file as an 'alien' package.

I have only tested the packaging on Fedora, and am eager to hear your 
feedback with other distributions.

NOTE:
The RPM does not install or configure the Django user interface yet.
