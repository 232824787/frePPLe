This directory is used to create an RPM distribution.
The resulting binary and source package can then be installed in your
Linux distribution.

The RPM should work fine for Red Hat, Fedora, Mandrake, SUSE...
Debian and derived distributions such as Ubuntu use a different packaging
mechanism, but can still install a RPM-file as an 'alien' package.

I have only tested the packaging on Fedora, and am eager to hear your 
feedback to make it work fine in other distributions too.
