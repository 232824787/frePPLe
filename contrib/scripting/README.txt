This is a script for generating access to the frepple library from a number of
scripting languages, such as Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk, Ruby, etc
You'll the SWIG (Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator) tool for using this.
See http://swig.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

Out of the many languages supported by SWIG, I am only working with the Perl,
Python and java languages.

To execute the examples you'll need to make sure the frepple shared library is
available in your path.
