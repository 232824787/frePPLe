This folder contains the integrated frePPLe - OpenERP solution.

The integration contains 2 parts:
  * An OpenERP module that defines extra models, fields and screens in OpenERP.
    It is used to allow frePPLe-specific input information to be maintained 
    in OpenERP.
  * An additional Django application to be deployed in the frePPLe web application.
    It contains the commands to pull data from OpenERP and push results back 
    to OpenERP.

See the reference manual for complete information on the functionality and
the installation.
