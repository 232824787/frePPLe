This is a script for creating a windows installer.
You need the NUllsoft program installed on your computer in order to rebuild the
installer executable.
Further details on http://nsis.sourceforge.net/

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The windows installer is not the preferred way of distributing the package. It
is only provided as a convenience for Windows-based users.
The proper and clean way remains the tar-ball.
