This is a script for creating a windows installer.
You need the NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) and cygwin installed on 
your computer in order to rebuild the installer executable.
Further details on http://nsis.sourceforge.net/

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The windows installer is not the preferred way of distributing Frepple. It
is only provided as a convenience for Windows-based users.
The proper way remains the source tar-ball.
