Create the model with callbacks:
  Calendar 'test' receives signal ADD
  Calendar 'test' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Calendar 'test' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  OperationFixedTime 'make end item' receives signal ADD
  Operation 'make end item' receives signal ADD
  OperationFixedTime 'make end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Operation 'make end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  OperationFixedTime 'make end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Operation 'make end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Item 'end item' receives signal ADD
  Item 'end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  OperationFixedTime 'delivery end item' receives signal ADD
  Operation 'delivery end item' receives signal ADD
  OperationFixedTime 'delivery end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Operation 'delivery end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  OperationFixedTime 'delivery end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Operation 'delivery end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Item 'end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  BufferDefault 'end item' receives signal ADD
  Buffer 'end item' receives signal ADD
  BufferDefault 'end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Buffer 'end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE

  OperationFixedTime 'make end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Operation 'make end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  OperationFixedTime 'make end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Operation 'make end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Flow between 'NULL' and 'NULL' receives signal ADD
  Flow between 'NULL' and 'NULL' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  OperationFixedTime 'delivery end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Operation 'delivery end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE

  Flow between 'end item' and 'make end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal ADD
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Item 'end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Item 'end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
Plan the model:
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE

  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
Erase the model:
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal REMOVE
  OperationFixedTime 'delivery end item' receives signal REMOVE
  Operation 'delivery end item' receives signal REMOVE
  Item 'end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Item 'end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  OperationFixedTime 'make end item' receives signal REMOVE
  Operation 'make end item' receives signal REMOVE
  BufferDefault 'end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  Buffer 'end item' receives signal BEFORE_CHANGE
  BufferDefault 'end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  Buffer 'end item' receives signal AFTER_CHANGE
  BufferDefault 'end item' receives signal REMOVE
  Buffer 'end item' receives signal REMOVE
  Calendar 'Capacity' receives signal REMOVE
  Calendar 'test' receives signal REMOVE
  Item 'end item' receives signal REMOVE
Recreate the model without callbacks:
